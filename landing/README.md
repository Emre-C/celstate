# Celstate

**Zero Artifacts. Zero Compromise.**

Celstate is a high-fidelity background removal service designed for perfectionists. While standard tools leave halos, glow, and jagged artifacts, Celstate delivers pixel-perfect transparency that holds up on any background—from complex game textures to dark mode UIs.

## 🚀 Landing Page Demo

The project includes a landing page demonstrating the "Truth" of edge quality across different background environments.

### Viewing the Demo
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the interactive comparison.

## ✨ Key Features
