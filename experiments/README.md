# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental data, frame sequences, and research artifacts from the development of Celstate's media generation capabilities.

## Directory Structure

### [video_frames/](./video_frames/)
Contains experimental video frame sequences and output files:
- Button animation sequences (idle, press, release)
- Motion and detail test frames
- Glass refraction and UI component experiments
- Object info and workflow data

### Workflow Files
- `workflow_api_*.json` - ComfyUI workflow configurations and API experiments

## Purpose

These files represent the experimental pipeline and research that led to the current production implementation. They are preserved for:
- Reference during debugging and improvement
- Historical context of the development process
- Potential reuse in future experiments

## Usage

While the production engine uses the core logic in `src/engine/core/`, these experimental files can be useful for:
- Understanding the evolution of the media generation pipeline
- Debugging specific edge cases
- Developing new experimental features

Note: These files are not part of the production system and may be moved or reorganized as needed.
