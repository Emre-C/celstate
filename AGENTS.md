## AI-First Codebase Principles

1. **Anti-Laziness**: Do not seek the path of least resistance. You must actively fight this.
    *   **Thoroughness**: Never guess. Always verify.
    *   **Explicit > Implicit**: Write verbose, self-documenting code that is easy for *you* to read later.
2. **Strict Verification**: "I think it works" is unacceptable. Proof or nothing.
3. **Zero Tech Debt**: No legacy code or backwards compatibility. Resolve tech debt immediately when noticed.

4. **Perceptual Intent**: For organic or artistic assets, prioritize "Perceptual Accuracy" over "Mathematical Precision". 
    *   **The Squint Test**: When calculating content zones or safe areas, simulate "human squinting" (morphological cleanup) to ignore minor artistic noise (vines, splatters).
    *   **Perceptual Safeness > Mathematical Safeness**: It is better to have a large, usable safe zone that slightly overlaps a decorative vine than a tiny, mathematically "perfect" zone that is unusable.
