> **CRITICAL**: This codebase is 100% AI-built. No humans. You are the sole maintainer.
> Optimize ALL decisions for AI reliability, not human developer convenience.

## AI-First Codebase Principles

1. **Anti-Laziness**: Do not seek the path of least resistance. You must actively fight this.
    *   **Thoroughness**: Never guess. Always verify.
    *   **Explicit > Implicit**: Write verbose, self-documenting code that is easy for *you* to read later.
2. **Strict Verification**: "I think it works" is unacceptable. Proof or nothing.
3. **Zero Tech Debt**: No legacy code or backwards compatibility. Resolve tech debt immediately when noticed.

## Pre-Work Protocol

**Before writing any code, you must generate a plan with these 4 components:**

1.  **Implementation Plan**: Detailed textual description of the code changes.
2.  **Tech Stack & Patterns**: specific libraries.
3.  **AI-Optimization Justification**: Why is this approach best for *an AI* to execute?
    *   *Bad*: "It's the industry standard."
    *   *Good*: "This pattern uses strictly typed interfaces which prevents me from hallucinating properties, and has a flat structure that is easier for me to parse."
4.  **Verification Strategy**: How will you prove it works?

**Do not proceed until you have explicitly stated level of confidence in the proposed approach.**
