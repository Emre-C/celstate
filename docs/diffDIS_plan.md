This plan has been split into two parallel agent guides so two AI agents can work concurrently without editing the same files.

## Agent Plan A — Integration (Primary)
**File:** `docs/diffDIS_plan_agent1_integration.md`
- Owns: core integration, pipeline replacement, CLI/API wiring.

## Agent Plan B — Verification & Benchmarking (Secondary)
**File:** `docs/diffDIS_plan_agent2_verification.md`
- Owns: golden test, benchmarks, metrics capture, docs/results.

---

**Phase 1–2 completed.** See `docs/diffDIS_audit.md` for vendoring audit and fixes.
