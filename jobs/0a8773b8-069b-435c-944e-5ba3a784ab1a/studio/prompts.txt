Original: A glass pill container
Enhanced: A Studio Ghibli-inspired whimsical art nouveau frame, intricately composed of swirling, delicate glass vines and leaves, embraces a clean empty void shaped like a smooth, translucent glass pill. The glass elements of the frame exhibit a gentle iridescence and subtle internal glowing edges, with a frosted texture on the leaf veins that subtly differentiates them from the main vine structures. Sharp studio lighting highlights the delicate craftsmanship and the varied translucency of the glass, creating a high-fidelity, dreamlike appearance without any atmospheric effects or external elements.
